# Systems Biology in Practice

The data repository of the Systems Biology in Practice Course.

## Organisation

### Data

The data folder contains all data files used by any report in this project.
Every "type" of data or data source is named and placed in it's own folder, accompanied with an R script which provides the necessary conversion/pre-processing steps.

#### Raw

Contains raw (external) data files that are used as input.

#### Processed

Contains data files generated by reports.

### Functions

(R) Functions custom made for this project (or not available as part of a package).

### Reports

Reports describe the data analysis performed as part of this project. At least every data source should have an report describing the process of data validation, quality checks and potentially the method used to generate processed data.

| Report | Purpose | Depends On | Exports | Exports To |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|------------|
| `measurements`    | Check OD Measurements         |   |   |   |
| `casy`            | Process Casy Count Data       |   | Cell Concentration and Cell Size | `casy/YYMMDD_casy_counts_diameter.csv` |
| `multicultivator` | Process Multi-Cultivator Data |   | Growth Rates | `growth/YYMMDD_growth_rates.csv` |
| `growth`          | Validate Growth Rate Data     | `multicultivator`|   |   |
| `cell_extracts`   | Calculate Lysis Efficiency    | `casy` | Lysis efficiency | `cell_extracts/YYMMDD_cell_extracts.csv` |
| `qpcr`            | Calculate # DNA Fragments     |   | # DNA Fragments       | `qpcr/YYMMDD_qpcr_fragments_PLATEID.csv` |
| `ploidy`          | Calculate Ploidy Level        | `cell_extracts`, `qprc`  | Ploidy Level | `ploidy/YYMMDD_chromosomes_per_cell.csv` |
| `transcriptomics` | Calculate changes in mRNA     |   | Fold Changes + P.values | `transcriptomics/YYMMDD_transcriptomics_deseq.csv` |
| `proteomics`      | Calculate changes in proteins |   | Fold Changes + P.values | `proteomics/YYMMDD_proteomics_METHOD.csv` |
| `metabolomics`    | Calculate changes in metabolites |   | Fold Changes + P.values | `metabolomics/YYMMDD_metabolomics_METHOD.csv` |
| `omics_integration` | Integrate proteomics and transcriptomics |  |  |  |

### Scripts

Small programs used to automate various taksks.
