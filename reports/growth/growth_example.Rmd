List all sample IDs that are contained in the dataset

```{r}

```

Show all the collected growth rates

```{r}

```

You harvested while the culture was crashing (negative growth). We actually harvested from "steady"-states. So we *can* use the growth rates from those samples. Create a plot with only the growth rates from sample in steady state.
NOTE: you can use assume all pre-course samples are from steady state.

```{r}
